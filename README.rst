Python wrapper for the Alpine API
=================================

Welcome to the official Python library for the Alpine API. In this first release we've focused on a subset of the full
API that we feel users will most frequently use.

Running a workflow and downloading the results::

    >>> import alpine as AlpineAPI
    >>> session = AlpineAPI.APIClient(host, port, username, password)
    >>> process_id = session.workfile.process.run(workfile_id)
